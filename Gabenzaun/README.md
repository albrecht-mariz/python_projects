# Guerrilla Cartography

## Atlas in a Day: Community

### Gabenzäune in Berlin

On May 16, 2020 more than 50 guerrilla cartographers came together online, from three continents and 10 countries, to produce an atlas in slightly less than 24 hours on the theme of Community.

This is my and Theresa Martens’ contribution. We decided to approach the topic through the solidarity fences in times of Covid-19. 

Gabenzäune are fences located at key intersections in many neighborhoods all over Germany. They are used to hang food, sleeping bags or toiletries in plastic bags with labels for people in need.

The concept of Gabenzäune originated in Hamburg and a few have been installed in Berlin in recent years as well. Due to covid-19 and the sudden closure of many institutions for homeless and more deprived people, we have been observing an increase in Gabenzäune all over Berlin. They are run on a voluntary basis, spread and organized through social media channels.

For us, these fences are a symbol of community on a neighborhood level. They illustrate what neighbors care about in times of social distancing. The sudden rise of these fences within a few weeks shows how we can influence the social infrastructure in our neighborhoods by doing small things. 

We hope the idea will reach other cities.
